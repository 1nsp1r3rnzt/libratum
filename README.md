# Libratum

Libratum allow you to focus on your studies by blocking unsubscribed channels. It imports your subscribed channels and allows videos to be played only from those channels.
The blocked videos are stopped from autoplaying and an overlay shows an inspirational image from /MotivationalPics from Reddit.


## Why

Initially, YouTube is a resource for entertainment rather than watching tutorials. The algorithm serves videos relevant to your previous searches and interests which lures users to waste time unconsciously. 

## Getting Started
I haven't got the time to move this project ahead.
If you want to try

1. switch on developer's mode in chrome extensions.
2. Import the extension.
3. You can make a YouTube account with only educational channels. 
4. CLick app icon and click authorize youtube.
5. It would import the list.

### Prerequisites

It might not work on UnGoogled-Chrome.
It depends on availability of chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow to request for a token to access your subscribed channels list.


# Todo
## User features
[] Allow User to delete the channels.
[] Allow user to add a channel manually in the list using channel id.

## Additional features
[] Create a same block feature for Reddit sub-reddits.

## Advanced features
[] Block videos on certain days and time as set by the user.
[] Gamify the extension by introducing the concept of karma based on total number of blocked vs allowed videos.
